## Overview

### Key features

- Using the useState Hooks to manage products, items and quantities.
- Help to load product data from a JSON file or an API.
- Map through the product data to render the list dynamically.
- Provide visual feedback for user actions, such as updating the cart count.s

### Benefits

- Users can easily browse through products, view details, and add items to their cart.
- Features like adding to cart, incrementing, and decrementing quantities make the interface interactive and engaging.
- Handling state updates for adding, incrementing, and decrementing items improves your skills in managing dynamic data.
- Loading product data from a JSON file or an API helps you practice data fetching and handling in React.

## Challenge

- Minimizing unnecessary re-renders to keep the application performant can be difficult, especially with frequent state updates.
- Mapping through the product data to render the list dynamically requires a good understanding of JavaScript array methods.
- Using styled-components or other CSS-in-JS solutions requires a different approach compared to traditional CSS.
- Debugging issues related to state management, rendering, and performance can be time-consuming.

## My Process

- Understanding the task;
- Separate it into smaller tasks (if possible), then solve them one by one.

## Built With

- Flexbox
- [React] - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

## What I learnt

- I discovered new keyboard shortcuts while working on the project.
- Better and faster working with keyboard only features of VSCode.
- I set a personal challenge to use only styled-components and avoid using className entirely.

## COntinue Development

- I'm continuing my journey to become a better frontend developer.
- I need to learn to use useReducer often for large project.
